# Enigma Machine
This would be my first project I designed from scratch. The idea came from reading a book called the innovators written by Walter Issacson. In the early ages, the development of computer was driven to solve complex mathematical problems in a short time and to win wars. One of the invention used to win a war was Alan Turing's enigma machince which was used to decipher enemies' secret messages. Here I created a simple enigma machine that can cipher and decipher messages. For now, it only has one method of ciphering/deciphering which I hope to build more type of ciphers in the future. 

## Let's Collab!
I wish to make this an open source collaborative project. As mentioned before, currently the enigma machine only has one type of cipher. Other type of ciphers I wish to add are monoalphabetic, homophonic, polygram substitution and many more. Any kind of feedback is welcomed (including tips of writing a clean code since I'm still new to web dev).
